### About Research and application of GAN based super resolution technology for pathological microscopic images

If you're new to SSRGAN, here's an abstract straight from the paper:

Despite the breakthroughs in accuracy and speed of single image super-resolution using faster and 
deeper convolutional neural networks, one central problem remains largely unsolved: how do we recover 
the finer texture details when we super-resolve at large upscaling factors? The behavior of 
optimization-based super-resolution methods is principally driven by the choice of the objective function. 
Recent work has largely focused on minimizing the mean squared reconstruction error. 
The resulting estimates have high peak signal-to-noise ratios, but they are often lacking high-frequency details and 
are perceptually unsatisfying in the sense that they fail to match the fidelity expected at the higher resolution. 
In this paper, we present SSRGAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) for image super-resolution (SR). 
To our knowledge, it is the first framework capable of inferring photo-realistic natural images for 4x upscaling factors. 
To achieve this, we propose a perceptual loss function which consists of an adversarial loss and a content loss. 
The adversarial loss pushes our solution to the natural image manifold using a discriminator network that is trained 
to differentiate between the super-resolved images and original photo-realistic images. In addition, 
we use a content loss motivated by perceptual similarity instead of similarity in pixel space. 
Our deep residual network is able to recover photo-realistic textures from heavily downsampled images on public benchmarks. 
An extensive mean-opinion-score (MOS) test shows hugely significant gains in perceptual quality using SSRGAN. 
The MOS scores obtained with SSRGAN are closer to those of the original high-resolution images than to those obtained 
with any state-of-the-art method.

### Model Description

We have two networks, G (Generator) and D (Discriminator).The Generator is a network for generating images. 
It receives a random noise z and generates images from this noise, which is called G(z).Discriminator is 
a discriminant network that discriminates whether an image is real. The input is x, x is a picture, 
and the output is D of x is the probability that x is a real picture, and if it's 1, it's 100% real, 
and if it's 0, it's not real.
